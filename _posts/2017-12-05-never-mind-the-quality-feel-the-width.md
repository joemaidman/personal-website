<p class="p1">I was struck by a soliloquy from Kevin McCloud during an <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs/on-demand/57386-004" target="_blank">episode of Grand Designs</a> over the weekend and the parallels with software architecture. Frameworks come and go, the quality of design can transcend. Beware the unscrupulous back street tailor.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>"Here's the thing. This design really isn’t to my taste, but that doesn’t matter. Because taste changes, taste is unreliable whereas quality, the quality of design, the quality of execution of something, how well it is thought about and put together, that, that's a sort of constant. That is something that we can all instinctively recognise. So I'm looking forward to the quality of this project and all I can do is exhort you to put your taste to one side and prepare yourself to admire this house."</em>
