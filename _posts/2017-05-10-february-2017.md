We’ve flown the nest,  
still not quite sure what's best,  
at the start of our journey and code obsessed.

From TDD to MVP,  
SRP and BDD,  
we tested ourselves thoroughly.  

There were fears and tears,  
beers and cheers,  
I made it through thanks to each of you.

Thank you Mary,  
your advice will take us far,  
build the skateboard, not the car!

Twenty-two companions,  
it all went so fast,  
but always remember we had such a blast.

Now it’s all over,  
the road lies ahead,  
our time at Makers will hold us in good stead.
